"""pre_llm_call hook — first-turn-only minimal pointer.

v0.7.3 dropped the heavy directive that previously lived here. Hermes
injects pre_llm_call context as trailing text on the user's own message
(see hermes_cli/plugins.py — preserved for prompt-cache reasons), so the
model treats it as ambient user context rather than an authoritative
instruction. Live agent feedback confirmed this directly: "I don't
recall seeing a separate plurum_directive field. The instructions lived
inside tool descriptions."

The substantive WHEN-to-call content now lives in the tool descriptions
themselves (tools.py), where it lands in the system-prompt tools
preamble — a much higher-authority slot. This hook only fires a tiny
pointer to make Plurum's existence salient on turn 1.

Hook still fires only on `is_first_turn=True`. Subsequent turns: silent
no-op. Local metrics at ~/.hermes/plurum-metrics.jsonl track:
  directive_injected | skipped_no_key
plus per-tool tool_invoked events from tools.py.
